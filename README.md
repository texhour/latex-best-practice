# LaTeX Best Practice

The first goal (and issue) is to help users find existing advice on LaTeX best practice.
To learn more, and to contribute, take a look at
[the first issue](../../issues/1) and [the list of open issues](../../issues).

This project arose out of the _Help and docs for LaTeX users_ 
TeX Hour on Thursday 2 September. You can watch the videos on 
[here, on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw1FZfIX1w7h74asldt29nO1XUiNrWSnz).
